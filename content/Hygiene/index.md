# Hygiene factors

I used to be a consultant. A source of energy drain was to continuously and repeatedly argue about what could be called software hygiene. We can about how we automate testing, what degree of automated testing is reasonable and desirable. We can discuss what _good_ means in the context of automated testing. We can argue on the tradeoffs between execution time and how many or how complex tests can be. What does not make sense is whether or not we should have automated testing. My completely undocumented statement is that hospital staff do not spend a lot of time arguing whether hands should be washed or not. 

Being a hygiene factor means it is something that should be adopted as soon as possible, and that it is a requisite for being an effective software engineer, also in the short term.

Systemic Software Engineering currently considers the following hygiene factors

- Automated testing
- Automated tests are not only run on the developers laptop
- Source Control is used
